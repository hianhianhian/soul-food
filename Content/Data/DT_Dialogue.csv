adamBranch7,adamIngredients1:1,"I always cleaned my room, by the way.",TRUE,None,4
adamBranch8,adamIngredients1:2,A lot of people just spread butter all over their bread but I can tell you’re not one of those people.,TRUE,None,1
adamBranch9,adamIngredients1:2,Little trick that mom picked up from one of her chef-y friends was to spread mayo instead of butter on the exterior faces of the bread.,FALSE,adamBranch10,2
adamBranch10,adamIngredients1:2,"Gives the sandwich that amazing color and crispness when it gets grilled up. It also adds a little overall tang, which is nice when you’re eating a metric ton of cheese.",TRUE,None,2
adamBranch11,adamIngredients1:2,"To this day, I still swear by swapping out the butter for mayo.",FALSE,adamBranch12,3
adamBranch12,adamIngredients1:2,Although I won’t complain either way. A grilled cheese is a grilled cheese. You can’t mess it up.,TRUE,None,3
adamBranch13,adamIngredients1:3,How did you figure out my all-time favourite Special Cheese Combo Mix™?,FALSE,adamBranch14,1
adamBranch14,adamIngredients1:3,"3 slices of all-American processed cheese, fresh out of their little plastic packets.",TRUE,None,1

adamBranch23,adamIngredients1:4,Back in school we used to get made fun of for playing our military simulator games. They’d call us nerds and other words I’d rather not mention.,FALSE,adamBranch24,4
adamBranch24,adamIngredients1:4,And then I signed up for the army.,TRUE,None,4
adamBranch25,adamIngredients1:5,Nothing really beats a good ol’ grilled cheese sandwich on rainy days. Days when you want to curl up in bed and forget all the shit you feel.,FALSE,adamBranch26,1
adamBranch26,adamIngredients1:5,Things used to be so simple when I was a kid. When mom was alive. I miss her.,FALSE,adamBranch27,1

adamBranch31,adamIngredients2:1,Mom would always let me be the one to test if the macaroni was perfectly cooked. It needs to be just a little undercooked with quite a chew to it,FALSE,adamBranch32,3
adamBranch32,adamIngredients2:1,"When the whole dish gets baked in the oven, the mac turns out perfect every time.",TRUE,None,3
adamBranch33,adamIngredients2:2,We always had to worry about money so we never used any of the fancy expensive cheese you’d see at the grocery store.,FALSE,adamBranch34,1
adamBranch34,adamIngredients2:2,Shredded cheddar cheese was relatively cheap and still tasted great.,TRUE,None,1
adamBranch35,adamIngredients2:2,Mom’s special technique was to cook the macaroni in the milk instead of in a separate bot of boiling water. It saves me from having to wash an extra pot!,FALSE,adamBranch36,2

adamBranch37,adamIngredients2:2,"You had to eat it right away, or it would turn lumpy and sticky. I never had a problem finishing my bowl right away though.",TRUE,None,3

adamBranch44,adamIngredients2:4,It’s such a simple addition but it really does make it feel special. Mom would always make her own breadcrumbs with whatever stale bread we had in the house.,FALSE,adamBranch45,2
adamBranch45,adamIngredients2:4,(It was almost always Wonder Bread. I just really like Wonder Bread okay?),TRUE,None,2
adamBranch46,adamIngredients2:4,"If we were in a rush, mom would just sprinkle breadcrumbs over the mac and cheese without baking it. It would still turn out great, just not as crunchy.",TRUE,None,3

adamBranch54,adamIngredients3:1,Mom would exclusively make her chicken noodle soup with seashells.,FALSE,adamBranch55,3

adamBranch56,adamIngredients3:1,Ever since she died.. I just call them conchiglie now.,TRUE,None,4
adamBranch57,adamIngredients3:2,I know it’s a super obvious thing to say but you can’t make chicken noodle soup without a hearty chicken broth to build on.,TRUE,None,1
adamBranch58,adamIngredients3:2,"The only secret to a good chicken broth is just a lot of TLC. That stands for tender, loving care. ",TRUE,None,2
adamBranch59,adamIngredients3:2,Time and a lot of love. My dad could never make a decent chicken broth.,FALSE,adamBranch60,3

adamBranch66,adamIngredients3:3,I don’t remember much else about him.,TRUE,None,4
adamBranch67,adamIngredients3:3,Mom never put cilantro in her chicken noodle soup.,TRUE,None,5
adamBranch68,adamIngredients3:4,I’m so glad these chicken bits aren’t chicken breast.,TRUE,None,1
adamBranch69,adamIngredients3:4,"It’s not that I hate chicken breast, it just always turns out dry and sandy, like eating the dirt when you’re crouching for cover in a trench.",TRUE,None,2
adamBranch70,adamIngredients3:4,This chicken is really well done. You could probably get away with serving up chicken breast and it’d still taste great.,TRUE,None,3
adamBranch71,adamIngredients3:5,"Every other chicken noodle soup sucks but yours is alright, mom’s is still the best tho.",FALSE,adamBranch72,1
adamBranch72,adamIngredients3:5,I miss her so much. I should have been there for her.,FALSE,adamBranch73,1

adamBranch77,adamIngredients4:1,It just wasn’t healthy and I didn’t think it was necessary to spend too much on desserts.,TRUE,None,2
adamBranch78,adamIngredients4:1,Mom would still insist on having me take an extra scoop. I’d always give her the extra scoop.,TRUE,None,3
adamBranch79,adamIngredients4:1,"Last Christmas I had the entire tub to myself for the first time in a long time. I set aside a scoop for mom though, for old times’ sake.",FALSE,adamBranch80,4
adamBranch80,adamIngredients4:1,How do you give presents to those who aren’t present with us anymore?,TRUE,None,4
adamBranch81,adamIngredients4:2,"I know chocolate sauce is really kiddish, but I just really enjoy seeing chocolate streaks all across the surface of my ice cream.",TRUE,None,1
adamBranch82,adamIngredients4:2,"When I was younger, mom would pretend to be an artist and splatter the chocolate sauce all over the ice cream.",FALSE,adamBranch83,2

adamBranch84,adamIngredients4:2,She used to tell me she had always wanted to be an artist. She even went to art school for awhile.,FALSE,adamBranch85,3

adamBranch90,adamIngredients4:3,I would rather buy a can of whipped cream nowadays instead of working it by hand.,FALSE,adamBranch91,3
adamBranch91,adamIngredients4:3,It’s just so much extra effort when I can just press a button and instantly have whipped cream in my mouth.,TRUE,None,3
adamBranch92,adamIngredients4:4,"Everyone’s got their favorite dessert fruit. You can have your mangos, your bananas and your blueberries, but strawberries are mine.",TRUE,None,1
adamBranch93,adamIngredients4:4,I’ve just always loved strawberries. I don’t ever remember a time I didn’t like them. ,TRUE,None,2

adamBranch102,adamIngredients4:5,My commanding officer told me that no hard feelings were had and wished me luck. He was nice.,TRUE,None,1

tutorialBranch7,tutorialIngredients2:1,"Putting a slice of bread into the toaster is honestly not very difficult if I do say so myself, but if you couldn’t already tell, I am a stickman without opposable thumbs.",TRUE,None,2
